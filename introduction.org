The three musketeer's of clientside Web, *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. They create

Indentifier). It is the address where our HTML/CSS/JS codes resides. After The

The browser parses HTML to DOM(Document Object Model) tree or content tree. The
rendering engine will parse style data both internal and external. With both the content
